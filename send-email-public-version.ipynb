    "**Translation:** There are different protocols that the programs we use to access and manage our emails use for messages: one for sending (SMTP), and two for reciving (we won't worry about those now). In order to ensure that our outbound emails stay secure on their way to a server (a mail carrier of sorts), we send them out over a port that has been agreed on as standard (port 465 or 587). \n",

# Coding-challenge-2020
A repository for working through practice coding problems in Python with Jupyter Notebook. 

Practice problems come from: Daily Coding Problem (https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/)  

Weekdays will be for lighter programming problems. Weekends will be a mix of more challenging problems, as well as going back to the easier problems earlier in the week to attempt to find more robust solutions (as well as to include a final writeup), as well as for cleaning up old repos. 

2020.01.26 (M): Reverse the bits

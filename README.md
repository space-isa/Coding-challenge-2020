# Coding-challenge-2020
This repository contains practice coding problems in Python3 (written in Jupyter Notebook). A scaled-down version of the #100DaysOfCode challenge, the goal here is to code (however imperfecty) for 30 consecutive days. 

Practice problems come from: Daily Coding Problem (https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/)  

Weekdays will be for easy to medium programming problems**.
Weekends will be for more challenging problems, as well as for reviewing all of the daily uploads for that week. The goal of the reviews are to: 1) find ways to improve a previous solution, and 2) produce a final writeup of what I learned in the process**. It is my hope that completed notebooks can be utilized as a learning/review tool. 

** In order to make room for marginal adjustments during the challenge (and life!), the specifics of the workflow is subject to change!
